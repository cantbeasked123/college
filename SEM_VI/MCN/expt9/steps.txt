localhost refers to the same machine (loopback address 127.0.0.1). Use it when running both server and client on one computer.

A device IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10) is used when the server and client run on different machines on the same network.
use ipconfig to find ip address and update it in the client code after running the server code first.
